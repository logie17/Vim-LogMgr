Introduction
=============

LogMgr is a simple log manager. 

Installation
=============

   doc/logmgr.txt
   plugin/logmgr.vim

To access this help file from within Vim you must first update your help
tags:

   :helptags ~/.vim/doc

The path may need to be modified depending on where you install to.
Once you have done this you can access the help with this command:

   :help logmgr

Within your .vimrc add the following global variable

    let logmgr_logs='/path/to/log/file:/path/to/log/file'

The logmgr_logs variable is a string that has log files delimited by ":".

Mappings
=================

The plugin defines some new mappings:

   \lox    Depending on how many log files you have setup. For example "\lo1" will open
           the first log file.
   \tc     Closes the buffer window

Note: \lox will refresh the buffer
